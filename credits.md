## Libraries

Catfood and Hairball depend on a large number of libraries from many sources
including:

1. Vertx

Many other projects and libraries are also relied on as indirect dependencies. We
would like to state our appreciation for all their hard work, without which none of
our efforts would be possible.

## Tooling

Catfood and Hairball were created using Eclipse, GIT, GitHub, Gradle, OpenJDK,
GraalVM Community Edition, and of course GNU/Linux and all the associated tools
and libraries. Additionally we used Mozilla Firefox in the development of the
client side web components, as well as the Chromium browser.
